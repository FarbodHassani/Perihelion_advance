# Perihelion_advance
Code written by Farbod Hassani and Jean-Pierre Eckmann, to solve the eom for a particle orbitting around a central object on a lattice. Similar to what is done in N-body codes.
Here we measure the perihelion advance to quantify the error on the orbit due to the discretization methos.
